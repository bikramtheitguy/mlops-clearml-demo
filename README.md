# 🧠 Iris Classification with ClearML (MLOps Demo)

This project demonstrates how to train ML models (Random Forest & Decision Tree) on the classic Iris dataset and track their performance using [ClearML](https://clear.ml).

✅ Built by: **Bikram Keshari Samal**  
🔗 Powered by: Python · scikit-learn · ClearML · Jupyter · Codespaces
## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔬 Logged Experiments (via ClearML)

All experiments are tracked and visualized in the [ClearML Dashboard](https://app.clear.ml/projects).

| Model            | Accuracy | ClearML Task |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Random Forest    | 1.00     | ✅ `Iris - Random Forest` |
| Decision Tree    | 1.00     | ✅ `Iris - Decision Tree`  |

You can view plots, compare metrics, and track parameters side-by-side.
